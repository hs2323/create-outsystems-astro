# OutSystems Astro Islands
Generates [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) for use in OutSystems that can create self contained interactive code elements from different frameworks. It allows an extension of the front-end with these dynamic libraries.

## When to use this library
- Custom interactive elements that would be difficult/not possible to build directly in OutSystems.
- Wrappers around interactive elements built in other front-end frameworks.
- Direct migration of external traditional code.

## When NOT to use this library
- You will most likely not need to use this library for most of the front-end development. This is similar in use to the custom code development in for the back-end in [O11](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/integration_with_external_systems/extend_logic_with_your_own_code/) and [ODC](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/extend_your_apps_with_custom_code/).
- If the functionality is easily buidable in Service Studio.
- Loading performance of component must be instant. The Astro Island will load after the page/screen has loaded since the initializer and tag will be loaded after.

## Current supported frameworks
- [Angular](https://analogjs.org/docs/packages/astro-angular/overview)
- [Preact](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/preact/)
- [React](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/)
- [Svelte](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/)
- [Vue](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/)

## Getting started
Run the Create OutSystems Astro generator:

### npm
```bash
npx create-outsystems-astro
```

### Yarn
```bash
yarn create outsystems-astro
```

### pnpm
```bash
pnpm dlx create-outsystems-astro
```

### Bun
```bash
bunx create-outsystems-astro
```

### Deno
The Deno DX command is available in [Deno 2.6](https://deno.com/blog/v2.6).
```bash
dx create-outsystems-astro
```

This will create the generated files as well as an example component.

## 🚀 Project Structure

```text

├── public/
├── src/
│   └── components/
│       └── Counter.tsx
│   └── images/

│       └── counter.astro
│   └── styles/
│       └── index.css
└── package.json
```

### Pages
Each page inside of the pages file should represent an Island that will be imported into OutSystems. This is for setup/development and the actual page will not be used for the final output.

### Components
The location of the component code. Each framework has its own separate folder.

### Images
Any image assets.

### Styles
Stylesheets that may apply to the component.

## 🧞 Commands

## Getting Started
Delete the demo application under the ```src``` folder and being to build your own application. 

## Converting to OutSystems

Once development is complete, run the output generation command:

### npm
```bash
npm run output
```

### Yarn
```bash
yarn run output
```

### pnpm
```bash
pnpm run output
```

### Bun
```bash
bun run output:bun
```

### Deno
```bash
deno run output:deno
```

This will create a set of files that will then need to be coverted to OutSystems components.
